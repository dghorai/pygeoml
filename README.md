# pygeoml

The Python package `pygeoml` aims to simplify machine learning tasks and automate spatial and non-spatial data science projects. Learning, enhancing and sharing knowledge in the field of data science is the purpose of this library. This library is a collection of existing models and their applications and has the following features for a comprehensive conceptual understanding of machine learning models: 
1) Inference with pre-trained models
2) Personalized training on existing models
3) Sample model from scratch
4) ML utility toolkit
