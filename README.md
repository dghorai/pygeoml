# pygeoml

A comprehensive, step-by-step guide on machine learning algorithms that can be implemented in Python and decode data science for practical applications. It also consisting of research on geospatial and machine learning toolsets and their application.

## Introduction

The Python package `pygeoml` aims to simplify machine learning tasks and automate spatial and non-spatial data science projects. This library is meant to be a resource for learning, growing, and sharing information about data science. This library is a collection of existing models and their applications and has the following features for a comprehensive conceptual understanding of machine learning models: 

1) Inference with pre-trained models
2) Personalized training on existing models
3) Transfer Learning
4) Sample model from scratch
5) ML utility toolkit
