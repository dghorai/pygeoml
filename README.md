# pygeoml

Data Science Application using AI/ML Algorithms. PyGeoML consisting of research on geospatial and machine learning toolsets and their application.

## Introduction

The Python package `pygeoml` aims to simplify machine learning tasks and automate spatial and non-spatial data science projects. Learning, enhancing and sharing knowledge in the field of data science is the purpose of this library. This library is a collection of existing models and their applications and has the following features for a comprehensive conceptual understanding of machine learning models: 

1) Inference with pre-trained models
2) Personalized training on existing models
3) Transfer Learning
4) Sample model from scratch
5) ML utility toolkit
