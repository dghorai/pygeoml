Handwritten Text Recognition Model using TensorFlow

Dataset Used: IAM Dataset (https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)

Model Overview: CNN + RNN + CTC Loss Layer
- CNN is used to extract features from the handwritten text image.
- RNN is used to predict sequential output per time step.
- CTC Loss function is used to predict output for each time-step.
