MLOps
=========

- Machine learning operations (MLOps) are a set of practices that automate and simplify machine learning (ML) workflows and deployments.
- MLOps is an area of expertise that merges machine learning (ML) with DevOps in order to automate the complete machine learning lifecycle, starting from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring.
- The MLOps lifecycle encompasses a perpetual procedure that involves data preparation, model training, model deployment, and model monitoring.
- MLOps tools and frameworks play a crucial role in automating the various tasks associated with the MLOps lifecycle. Notable examples of such tools and frameworks encompass MLFlow and Kubeflow Pipelines.
- The MLOps approach encompasses a collection of principles and methodologies employed for the implementation of MLOps. These encompass continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), treating data as a product, and monitoring and evaluation.
- The implementation of MLOps entails the practical application of the MLOps approach. This encompasses various aspects such as data management, modeling techniques, deployment strategies, and continuous monitoring.
