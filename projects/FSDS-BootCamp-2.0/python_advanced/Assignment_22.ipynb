    "Arrays are a type of data structure in which multiple elements of the same type are represented by a single name. The elements are accessed randomly using the index number, and the arrays allocate memory in contiguous locations for all elements. This eliminates the possibility of additional memory being allocated in the case of arrays, thus avoiding memory overflow or shortage in arrays. As a result, lists and numPy Arrays are often preferred. This is one of the reasons why few people are aware that Python has an implicit Array type. However, when something is limited, it must provide advantages. This is known as a \"trade-off\". In this example, the size of the Python Array is smaller than that of the Python List.\n"
