    "\n",
    "The term numerical data refers to any data where the data points are precise numerical values. This data is also referred to as quantitative data. It can be used as a measure of a property's value, such as the price of a house, or as a calculation, such as the number of residential units in a city, or the number of houses sold in a city in the preceding year.  The two main types of numerical data are continuous data and discrete data. While continuous data can assume a value within a given range, discrete data has different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Categorical Data`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data is composed of numerical values, such as the position, team, and hometown of a hockey player. For instance, the colour red is represented by the value of 1, and the colour blue by the value of 2. However, these numerical values are not mathematically meaningful and cannot be aggregated or averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time-Series Data`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is basically a sequence of numbers that are collected over a certain time period at regular intervals. It's really important, especially in certain industries like finance, agriculture, etc. Each piece of data has a specific time value attached to it. For example, it could be a date or a time stamp that we can use to track trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Text Data`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, text is just a cluster of words. Most of the time, the first thing we do with text is change it into numbers using cool functions like bag of words formulation. Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses string-based data, which is usually comments, comments or reviews.\n"

Many machine learning algorithms suffer greatly from high dimensionality, which is why this process becomes so important.\n"

    "- Outliers can be identified using a variety of methods, including descriptive statistical techniques, graphical techniques, or algorithm-based outlier detection. For instance, the average, standard deviation and quartile of the data can be calculated and the IQR (Interquartile Range) can be used to identify outliers. Outliers are those values that are greater than or equal to 1.5x the IQR of the median data. Alternatively, data points can be plotted using a box plot, scatter plot, or histogram, allowing for a visual inspection of the distribution and distribution of the data points.\n",
    "- If the outliers are in small numbers and their deletion does not cause a significant decrease in data, they can be discarded along with the whole data point. Conversely, if the outliers are very extreme and small in number against a high-dimensional data set, they can be replaced by imputed values. Outliers may also be providing some information to the data in the event of skewed distributions, in which case they must be retained.\n"

It is uses dot to represent values for two different numerical variables.  On the horizontal and vertical axes, the position of each dot indicates the values for a single data point. Thus, this visualization illustrates the concept of bivariate relationship. Other non-linear relationships, such as quadratic and trigonometric relationships, can be approximated and visually identified between two variables. Additionally, outliers can be identified using scatter plots.\n"
