You feed the algorithm a bunch of labelled images of dogs or cats, and it'll learn to tell the difference between the two. When we put in a new image of a dog or cat that it hasn't seen, it'll use the algorithms it's learned and figure out if it's a cat or a dog. That's what supervised learning is all about, especially when it comes to image classification.\n",

    "- Regression method helps to forecast or explain a specific number based on a collection of previous data. For example, a property price can be predicted based on past pricing data and its associated data for comparable properties.\n",
    "- Ensemble models are models that combine multiple base learners that work in parallel to produce results. One of the key features of an ensemble model is that the more diverse the base learners, the more powerful the combination is and hence, the more accurate the predictions. Following are the types of Ensemble models:\n",
    "    - Bagging, also known as Bootstrap aggregation, is when multiple base learners are learning on a subset of data. After that, a majority vote is used based on the individual base learner results to produce the final result.\n",
    "    - Boosting is primarily used to mitigate model bias. Several base learners are taught in a sequence where each learner fills in the gaps left by the previous one to create a strong model.\n",
    "    - A stacking model is a collection of several base learner models that are built in parallel and independent of one another. All the models generate predictions that are used to build a meta classifier. The meta classifier trains on the predictions produced by the base models. The resulting meta classifier is then used as a final prediction. The space and time complexity issue is very large for stacking models.\n",
    "    - A cascading model is created when there is a high probability of making a prediction error. A threshold is selected for several base learners. If a base learner is confident about its prediction (probability>0.99), then the learner’s solution is considered the final solution. Otherwise, the problem is passed to a more advanced, complex model that solves the same problem as the previous one. Either the problem gets resolved with probability>0.99, or it keeps getting passed to a more complex model that is guaranteed to solve the problem.\n"

Decision Trees are based on the idea that you get the most info from dividing data points using criteria. Depth is a hyper-parameter for Decision Trees, so it needs to be fine-tuned. Bigger depths make it over-fitting, while smaller ones make it under-fitting. For IRIS dataset, you can classify the data points by each passed criteria (Petal length, Petal width, Sepal length and Sepal width).\n"
